		<h1>Long, tan, and handsome</h1>

		<p>Below are long, tan, handsome people going to prom</p>

		<h1>Image tests with different file type</h1>
		<h2>absolute file path</h2>
		<p>This makes the most sense to me.</p>
		<p>using the full absolute path on windows machine you just have to copy file path from files app</p>
		<!-- full path -->
		<img src="C:\Users\karlt\OneDrive\Documents\web-projects\windows-test-project\images\long-tan-handsome.png" alt="long, tan, handsome image">
		<br>

		<h2>relative path</h2>
		<p>relative path is the easiest</p>
		<!-- relative path -->
		<img src="images\long-tan-handsome.png" alt="long, tan, handsome image">
		<br>

		<h2>absolute path from url</h2>
		<p>just the full link of a hosted image I think</p>
		<p>not sure how it works in the wild</p>
		<img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg" alt="w3schools hiking image">

		<h3>link from imgur</h3>
		<p>not as straight forward because of the way images are hosted</p>
		<p>I <strong>think</strong> image urls have to be the url of the actual image location and not the page which they are displayed</p>

		<h3>Differences in url displays</h3>
		<p>In this case imgur stores their images on a url separate from the gallery url:</p>
		<br>
		<h4>gallery url that does not display the image:</h4>

		<code>https://imgur.com/gallery/VMn85Rk</code>
		<br>

		<img src="https://imgur.com/gallery/VMn85Rk" alt="broken image link">
		

		<h4>url that does display the image</h4>
		<code>https://i.imgur.com/GmqjVTq.jpg</code>
